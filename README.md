## Installation

Experience running Node.js apps is recommended. CSMM is tested on and developed for Linux. It will *probably* also work on Windows.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Steam API key

    Go to the [Valve API key page](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and register a key.

- Discord bot account

    Go to the [Discord developer page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. You must also make this application a bot account.

    Collect the following values from the page:
    * Client ID
    * Client secret
    * Bot token
  
- MySQL

    Set up a user and corresponding database.

### Installing and configuring the application

1. Clone this repo to your machine.
2. Run `npm install --only=prod` to install the dependencies
3. Copy the .env.example file to .env
   
    Fill in the info you've gathered so far. For the DBSTRING, a special syntax is used. You should replace anything in [] with your personal database values.

```
DBSTRING=mysql2://[USER]:[PASSWORD]@localhost:3306/[DATABASE_NAME]
```

CSMM_HOSTNAME is used to generate links, CORS and other things. You should set this to the ip/domain you will access CSMM from. For example `CSMM_HOSTNAME=http://localhost:1337` or `CSMM_HOSTNAME=https://csmm.yourserver.com` **DO NOT ADD A TRAILING SLASH**

You are now ready to start the application! ðŸŽ‰ Run `node app.js` to start it.

### Optional: Add redis support

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is used for caching values and storing sessions. To enable redis support, add `REDISSTRING=redis://localhost:6379` to your env file.
